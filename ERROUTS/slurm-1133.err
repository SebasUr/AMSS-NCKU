/home/sauriber2/AMSS-NCKU/plot_GW_strain_amplitude_xiaoqu.py:574: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  plt.figure( figsize=(8,8) )                                   ## figsize controls figure size
