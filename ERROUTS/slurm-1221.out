     AMSS-NCKU is an open source numerical relativity code 
     It can be used to simulate the dynamical evolution on mergering process of black hole systems, 
 calculating the variation of gravitational field, black holes' trajectories, and gravitational wave 
 emissions through directly solving the Einstein field equations  

     This AMSS-NCKU code uses the finite-difference method to evaluate the numerical simulation. The 
 finite-difference schemes can be chosen as: 2nd order, 4th order, 6th order, 8th order. 
     The computation equation form in AMSS-NCKU code can be chosen as: BSSN equations, Z4C equations, 
 BSSN equations coupled with scalars (in f(R) theory), BSSN equations coupled with electromagnetic 
 fields. 
     The numerical grid system in this code includes: patch AMR grid, shell-patch AMR grid. 

     Furthermore, This code has fulfilled the CPU and GPU hybrid calculation.
